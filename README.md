# Get All Exams Released by SOA

Have you got tired of clicking all the links in SOA's website to download all the past exams? You come to the right place.

This `R` script will scrape all the available files in [SOA's website](https://www.soa.org/education/exam-req/syllabus-study-materials/edu-multiple-choice-exam), and download it for you.

All you need is `R` ([download here](https://cloud.r-project.org)) and `RStudio` ([download here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)). 
You might also need some basic knowledge on how to run a `R Markdown` in `RStudio`.

## Directions
- Open `get_past_exams.Rmd` script in `RStudio`. It will install all the required packages for you.
- Run all the cells except the last 2 cells.
- In the second-to-last cell, change the exam name to the exam you want to download.
  - The provided code is trying to download all files for Exam PA. You can change it to other exams.
    ```{r}
    # change Exam PA to your exam in the cell
    download.files.data <- files.data %>% filter(exam == 'Exam PA')  
    ```
  - You can refer to the previous cells in the script on what are the available exams.
- Run the last cell to download the exam. 
  - All files will be downloaded in the same location as this `R` project.
  - There will be a folder for each exam sitting.
  - It should work for different operating systems.
